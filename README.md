### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm **fishsticksnom**, a guy who loves coding and learning new things. I'm passionate about Linux, Bash scripting, Python, and JavaScript. I'm always on the lookout for new projects to work on and new people to collaborate with. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me creating stuff with Arduinos or building mechanical keyboards. Thanks for stopping by my profile, and feel free to reach out if you want to chat!
